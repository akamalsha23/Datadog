Whats the output 
telnet 6-1-3-app.agent.datadoghq.com 443

are you able to manually establish this connection?

Could you please try to curl the endpoint 
curl https://6-13-0-app.agent.datadoghq.com/api/v1/series?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY

Outgoing UDP traffic over the port 123 should be allowed so the Agent can confirm that the local server time is reasonably 
accurate according to the Datadog NTP servers
